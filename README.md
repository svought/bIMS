<h1 align="center">bIMS</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
A small buisness (lowecase b in bIMS) inventory management system designed to track inventory for small companies and make oredering an easier process.<br /><br />

<h2>Why bIMS</h2>
I aim to incorperate machine learning later in the developement life cycle to predict the buisnesses needs for a predetermined set of time (weekly, monthly, ect.). bIMS will produce a list of predicted items that will need to be ordered, this list will be based on your companies history of sales.<br /><br />

<h2>The Process</h2>
In creating bIMS, I intned to start with getting the database set up and running. Then I will get a small java program running and interacting with the database from the MYSQL server. After that I will add CRUD capabilities for the user. Over time, I will add more features that will improve the usability of bIMS.<br /><br />

<h2>Obstacles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Design database layout</li>
<li>Creating database</li>
<li>Normalizing database</li>
<li>Get simple java program to interact with database</li>
<li>UI desing process</li>
<li>Adding CRUD operations</li>
<li>Creating reporting system</li>
<li>Adding inventory management features</li>
<li>Hash user passwords for better security</li>
<li>Learn ML and incorperate for predictions</li>
<li>UX design process</li>
<li>Continuously testing program</li>
<li>Determine when first version can be published</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goals</h2>
My goal with this project is to get hands on experience outside of the class room. Experience desired includes but is not limited to learning how to set up a MYSQL databes, connect and interact with said database from java program, build a larger scale project, more practice with soucre control, and data analysis with machine learning.
